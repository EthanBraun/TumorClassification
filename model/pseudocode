create dataframe from csv

shuffle data
split into train and test sets
split into x and y
generate synthetic train data to balance classes
min-max scale x data to (0, 1)
convert labels to more useful format

create encoder and autoencoder networks
fit trainX to itself with autoencoder
encode features to reduce dimensionality

create dataframe for visualization
visualize encoded features with plot

train classifier on encoded features of training set

determine accuracy of predictions with test set
